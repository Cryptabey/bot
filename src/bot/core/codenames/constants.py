GUIDE = """\n
Codenames is a word guessing game that can be played with 2 teams of 2+ players.
* Every team has a spymaster and operatives.
* Each team has 8/9 cards that belong to them, and the spymaster's job is to give one word clues that point their operatives to the correct cards.
* The operatives can guess the card by simply typing the name of it.
* **The clues must be one word only and must not contain the names of cards.**
* There is also a black card (Assassin) which, if guessed, ends the game and results in a win for the other team.
* Guessing white cards results in your team's turn being over.
